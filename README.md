## Problem 1: Maps practice
1.1) Write a function `hasManyVowels`, for an arbitrary string, determines whether the string contains at least two of each vowel. Use a data structure `Map<Character, Integer>` to keep track of counts and `toCharArray()` to change `s` to a list of characters. 

1.2) Similarly, write `hasManyOfType` where instead of values, the user can specify the characters the string must have and how many of each. `hasManyOfType(s, "aeiou", 2)` is the same as `hasVowels(s)`.

Here are some sites where a map is used as a counter:

## Problem 2: Maps practice, continued
Write a function `addDelivery` which, for a stream of FruitOrders, tallies the inventory left in the store at the end of the month. `itemCount` should add with each delivery, while `oldestDate` remains unchanged once set.

## Problem 3: Trees
Refer to the trees lecture for help in getting started: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NZeue2naoEM7WkQSUhbSmiLm5MGcamoKhL36YkRsiLk/edit?usp=sharing 

3.1) Write a preorder traversal which will prints all the leaves of a tree. A leaf is a node that has no children, i.e. node.left is null and node.right is null. This should be a normal preorder traversal, except that only some nodes are printed.


3.2) Write an inorder traversal which prints the values of the tree from right to left. In class, we looked at an inorder traversal, left to right.
